# Objective

To explore the journey of professionals who transitioned into data careers, analyzing the challenges they encountered and the key factors that influenced their success in the field.

- We will look at the following criteria to provide insights;

1. What does an average salary of a data professional look like?
2. What are the favourite programming languages used by data professionals?
3. What job roles do they fill in data sector?
4. How difficult is it to break into data field?
5. What are the country of the participants?
6. What is the work/life balance and salary satisfaction?


# Data Source

The data was collated from an online questionnaire shared on social media platforms to generate response from professionals and enthusiasts who are in data field.  

The dataset can be accessed [find it here](https://github.com/Ugondu/DataCareerProgressionAnalysis/blob/main/Assets/DataSets/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx)


# Stages

- Design
- Development
- Visualization
- Analysis


# Design

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | Exploring the data |
| Power BI | Visualizing the data via interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Hosting the project documentation and version control |



# Development

- An end to end solution will involve the following steps;

1. Get the dataset
2. Explore the dataset using Excel
3. Load the dataset into Power BI
4. Clean and normalize the data with Power BI
5. Generate findings based on the insights
6. Write documentation on GitHub
7. Publish and host findings on GitHub



## Data Cleaning

To refine and normalise the data available, the following steps are followed;

1. Remove columns that are not relevant to the analysis
2. Create "Average Salary" column by splitting the "Salary" column using the "Split Column" function
3. For columns with "others: specify" option, we split and group all to "Others" using split column function


# Visualization


## Results


The final dashboard will provide insights into these factors

# Analysis

## Findings

From the data ganerated from the survey, we derived insights based on the following criteria;

1. What are the favourite programming languages used by data professionals?
2. What is the average salary by job roles?
3. How difficult is it to break into data field?
4. What are the country of the participants?

## Insights

From the survey, about 20% of the participants are located or work for companies based in the USA, with the canadian participants making up the survey with 32 entries.

We deduce that over 50% of the participants are currently working as data analyst in their various roles. 60% of the participant preffered Python programming language in their daily activities, followed by R language. We can associate this to the number of data analysts, data engineers and data scientists who participated in the survey. 

Regarding salary, on average, the data scientists are paid more yearly with more than 90k dollars annually, while data analysts earned between 50 to 55k yearly. While 4% of the participants felt it was very easy to transition, 43% felt indifferent aboout it, with 7% stating transition was very difficult.


# Conclusion

In the data field, the data scientist make the most money on average, while Python language seem to be very popular amongst the professionals.

So to effectively transition into the data space, learning Python langauge is vital while targetting high paying jobs like data scientist could be important depending on what motivates the individual.
